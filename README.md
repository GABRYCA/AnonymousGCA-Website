# Info
Official AnonymousGCA's Website, now with SvelteKit!

[Online Website!](https://www.anonymousgca.eu/)

Please note: May have not been deployed yet, soon I'll deploy the SvelteKit version here, for now, there could be the older version made with vanilla HTML, CSS, AOS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
